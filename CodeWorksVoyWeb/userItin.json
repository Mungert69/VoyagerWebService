With almost all international flights arriving in Havana and with its unique heritage and history the Capital City of Cuba is a great place to start any tour.  With this 17 night suggestion there’s enough time in each place to properly enjoy the distinct contrasts between the different regions of this fascinating island.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\nWith 4 nights in Havana there’s time to explore the old city and a bit further afield to Revolution Square and the fortress of El Morro and even fit in an excursion to the spectacular Vinales Valley.\r\n</p>","TripTag":"Tag test update data","TourDepartureDates":null,"TourFlightInfo":null,"TourNotes":null,"TourPrice":null,"Country":null}
