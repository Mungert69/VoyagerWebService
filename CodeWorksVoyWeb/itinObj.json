Dating back to the beginning of the 16th century the city has been through numerous upheavals but is currently undergoing a major revival as the historic heart of the old city is renovated after years of neglect and Cuba opens up to the outside world once more. As Cuba's political, cultural and historic centre there is enough to see and do in Havana to warrant going no further. However, the majority of our clients will stay in the Old Town for the first few days of their holiday before moving on and for many it is enough just to spend their time exploring the many alleys and squares of this compact part of the City. For clients who have more time or wish to delve deeper, Havana has plenty more to offer.","PicFileName":"HAVANAinglaterraFromAcrossSquareWithOldBlueCar.jpg","PicFileNames":["HAVANAinglaterraFromAcrossSquareWithOldBlueCar.jpg","HAVANAmuseumOfTheRevolution.jpg","havanaGENERALcapitol.jpg","HAVANAcathedralSquareWithGreenChairs.JPG","HAVANAbrightGreenCar2.jpg","HAVANACastleWithCannons.jpg","HAVANAplazaViewFromTerraceCafe.jpg"],"Subtitle":null,"Catagory":null,"Tag":null,"Panel1":"Excursions","Panel2":"Food","Panel3":"Getting There","Panel4":"Hotels","Panel5":"Beaches","Panel6":null,"Panel7":null,"Panel8":null,"Panel9":null,"PureHtml":null},"HotelCard":{"AccommodationRoomSpecification":{"Pkey":2306,"AccommodationId":443,"AccommodationName":"Havana Superior Casa","RoomType":"Standard","NumberOfRooms":"4","GeneralCopy":null,"ContractRoomBasis":false,"RoomSharing":true,"PrivateBathroom":false,"AirConditioning":false,"CeilingFan":false,"SatelliteTv":false,"Cdplayer":false,"Telephone":false,"Hairdryer":false,"MiniBar":false,"MiniFridge":false,"LivingArea":false,"TerraceBalcony":false,"DiningArea":false,"SeaviewAvailable":false,"LakeView":false,"Kitchen":false,"Kitchenette":false,"PrivatePool":false,"PrivateGarden":false,"IroningFacilities":false,"Safe":false,"NoSmokingRoomAvailable":false,"Hammocks":false,"OtherFacilities":false,"RoomSharingNote":null,"AirConditioningNote":null,"CeilingFanNote":null,"PrivateBathroomNote":null,"HairdryerNote":null,"SatelliteTvnote":null,"CdplayerNote":null,"MiniBarNote":null,"MiniFridgeNote":null,"LivingAreaNote":null,"TerraceBalconyNote":null,"SeaviewAvailableNote":null,"LakeViewNote":null,"KitchenNote":null,"KitchenetteNote":null,"DiningAreaNote":null,"PrivatePoolNote":null,"PrivateGardenNote":null,"IroningFacilitiesNote":null,"SafeNote":null,"NoSmokingRoomAvailableNote":null,"HammocksNote":null,"TelephoneNote":null,"OtherFacilitiesNote":null},"AccommodationDescription":{"AccommodationId":443,"UseIt":true,"AccommodationName":"Havana Sup Casa","Provider":"3","Country":null,"Region":"","Place":null,"PlaceName":"Havana","Location":"","AccommodationStandard":"3","AccommodationType":"6","DescriptionNote":"Casa particulars are private homes which are licenced to accept foreign tourists as guests.

","DescriptionLong":"For many visitors to Cuba the most abiding memories that they take home will be of Havana, Cuba's unique, vital and enchanting capital city. Dating back to the beginning of the 16th century the city has been through numerous upheavals but is currently undergoing a major revival as the historic heart of the old city is renovated after years of neglect and Cuba opens up to the outside world once more. As Cuba's political, cultural and historic centre there is enough to see and do in Havana to warrant going no further. However, the majority of our clients will stay in the Old Town for the first few days of their holiday before moving on and for many it is enough just to spend their time exploring the many alleys and squares of this compact part of the City. For clients who have more time or wish to delve deeper, Havana has plenty more to offer.","PicFileName":"HAVANAinglaterraFromAcrossSquareWithOldBlueCar.jpg","PicFileNames":["HAVANAinglaterraFromAcrossSquareWithOldBlueCar.jpg","HAVANAmuseumOfTheRevolution.jpg","havanaGENERALcapitol.jpg","HAVANAcathedralSquareWithGreenChairs.JPG","HAVANAbrightGreenCar2.jpg","HAVANACastleWithCannons.jpg","HAVANAplazaViewFromTerraceCafe.jpg"],"Subtitle":null,"Catagory":null,"Tag":null,"Panel1":"Excursions","Panel2":"Food","Panel3":"Getting There","Panel4":"Hotels","Panel5":"Beaches","Panel6":null,"Panel7":null,"Panel8":null,"Panel9":null,"PureHtml":null},"HotelCard":{"AccommodationRoomSpecification":{"Pkey":2306,"AccommodationId":443,"AccommodationName":"Havana Superior Casa","RoomType":"Standard","NumberOfRooms":"4","GeneralCopy":null,"ContractRoomBasis":false,"RoomSharing":true,"PrivateBathroom":false,"AirConditioning":false,"CeilingFan":false,"SatelliteTv":false,"Cdplayer":false,"Telephone":false,"Hairdryer":false,"MiniBar":false,"MiniFridge":false,"LivingArea":false,"TerraceBalcony":false,"DiningArea":false,"SeaviewAvailable":false,"LakeView":false,"Kitchen":false,"Kitchenette":false,"PrivatePool":false,"PrivateGarden":false,"IroningFacilities":false,"Safe":false,"NoSmokingRoomAvailable":false,"Hammocks":false,"OtherFacilities":false,"RoomSharingNote":null,"AirConditioningNote":null,"CeilingFanNote":null,"PrivateBathroomNote":null,"HairdryerNote":null,"SatelliteTvnote":null,"CdplayerNote":null,"MiniBarNote":null,"MiniFridgeNote":null,"LivingAreaNote":null,"TerraceBalconyNote":null,"SeaviewAvailableNote":null,"LakeViewNote":null,"KitchenNote":null,"KitchenetteNote":null,"DiningAreaNote":null,"PrivatePoolNote":null,"PrivateGardenNote":null,"IroningFacilitiesNote":null,"SafeNote":null,"NoSmokingRoomAvailableNote":null,"HammocksNote":null,"TelephoneNote":null,"OtherFacilitiesNote":null},"AccommodationDescription":{"AccommodationId":443,"UseIt":true,"AccommodationName":"Havana Sup Casa","Provider":"3","Country":null,"Region":"","Place":null,"PlaceName":"Havana","Location":"","AccommodationStandard":"3","AccommodationType":"6","DescriptionNote":"Casa particulars are private homes which are licenced to accept foreign tourists as guests.
